### Description
  We were instructed to create a Swing Arm from a group of drawings and dimensions. After we must change dimensions of the swing arm in order to test whether or not it was constrained properly. This will help us prepare for your Onshape certification test.

### Reflection
    I struggled with this one at first because I was drawing on the wrong plane. 
    I needed to create a sketch from the side and just extrude pieces at different depths rather than
    create multiple shapes from multiple planes. I also needed to learn to constrain rough shapes before 
    fully dimensioning geometry.
